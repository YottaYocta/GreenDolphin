# GreenDolphin

GreenDolphin is an open-source recording looper and analysis tool designed for musicians who want to transcribe music or learn songs by ear.

Developed for efficiency and uninterrupted practice, GreenDolphin helps you spend less time scrubbing through a recording so you can focus on the music itself.
